    <p>When used to fight evil, it is the strongest one-handed weapon in the game. It also never really breaks, which is super handy. And the beams of light are really handy for hunting. Just make sure to read the full guide before you try going to get it.</p>

    <h4>Where:</h4>
    <p> So basically you gotta go to the Korok Forest in the Lost Woods (which is kinda tough to get to but you can find a guide <a href="https://www.polygon.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-guide-walkthrough/2017/3/10/14888780/botw-wild-lost-woods" target="_blank">here</a>. (You can just fast-travel to a nearby shrine once you get there though). Once you get to the Korok Forest, you'll see a pedestal with the Master Sword in it. You'll need exactly 13 hearts, 10 more than the start (yellow hearts don't count) to pull the sword out of the pedestal. Once you get far enough in the game, you can just go to the Horned Statue, trade out all of your stamina for hearts, and go get the sword. You can then go back and swap them back after</p>
