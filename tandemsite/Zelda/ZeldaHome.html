    <h5>Hello, and welcome to Goron City. I made this site because I <s>made</s> am making a spreadsheet. Spreadsheets are sometimes<br> kinda hard to read, and they're big, and it can be hard to find things too. So I decided to make a mirror kinda thing on my webpage.<br> It's easier than a spreadsheet, and it's cooler too! <s>And maybe someday I can get an ad.</s><br>  I think that this website will be cool, because I just found a whole bunch of info, and put it together! It's not just me though, because I have some friends (currently just one friend) helping me! You can help me maybe! Email me at my email, which I will tell you here. <a href="mailto:botwmagicfood@gmail.com">Here!</a> Or you can just email me here: botwmagicfood@gmail.com! Anyways, I do really need your help. Email me so you can give me advice for my site. Bye Bey!</h5>
