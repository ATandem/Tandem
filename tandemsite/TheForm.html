I'm gonna type a lot just to make sure that this link is easy to click. So anyways. Why are you here? Did you come for the Zelda Spreadsheet? Did you wanna join Tandem? I hope you did. If you didn't, you're lost. And the spreadsheet is not ready for the public yet, but you can, like, give me money. The link to give me money isn't here yet. You don't have to give me money, but you can email me. That link is also not here yet. Another thing that isn't here yet is the response thing. I will let you respond to me. Are you satisfied? Well I'm not. Someday, you might be able to make accounts here on Tandem! Until then, you can just take this form, and hope for the best. Do you want a hint? Ok. Why do you want a hint? It's a pretty easy test, but fine. Here: I enjoy everything, but not creativity. Here's another: I don't trust people that live in Flatland. The final hint is hidden in this paragraph, with the words of 7 1 12 3, and the letters of 3. Welp! I don't wanna make the test too easy! I guess I gotta go. Bye<a>
